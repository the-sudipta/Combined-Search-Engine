For Deployment Purpose, Run : npx next build

And in the next.config.mjs file, you have to add

output: 'export',

& if there is any images: {} mentioned in that file then,

unoptimized: true,

//=======================================

the 2 line code should be look like this below. You have to notice where i have put those 2 lines in the code.

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    output: 'export',
    images: {
        unoptimized: true,
        domains: [
            "random.imagecdn.app",
            "img.icons8.com"
        ]
    }
};

export default nextConfig;
